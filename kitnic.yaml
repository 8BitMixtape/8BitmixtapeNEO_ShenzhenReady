summary: The key feature of the new 8Bit Mixtape is the easiness of uploading new codes using an audio communication protocol, means just playing a .wav sound file from your computer/smart phone (or walkman). A specific bootloader (TinyAudioBoot) has to be installed on the chip to be able to do so.
